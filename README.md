# V-Climb

> V-Climb an interactive guide to buying vegan climbing shoes

V-Climb is a database of all the confirmed vegan climbing shoes there is on the market today. This is my first full Typescript project, and I'm now only going to be using Typescript going forward. The database is built in PostgreSQL using Prisma.io to interact with the CRUD frontend.
